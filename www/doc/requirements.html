    <h3>I. Introduction</h3>

    <p>This document outlines necessary functionality and behavior of
      the new ACS 4.0 Bulletin Board system (herein referred to as bboard).

    <p>Our intent (as of 8/2000) is to start with a simple
      implementation that can accomodate future advanced functionality.
      As a result, these requirements may not prescribe functionality
      present in the ACS 3.4 bboard system.  We are using the
      uslaw-bboard module as inspiration for a lightweight
      implementation.

    <p>Futhermore, this document is conservative in attempting to
      describe the ultimate framework for modular web based messaging.
      We hope such an architecture may well be born out of iterative
      process when designing this system.  However, the scope is being
      primarily limited to functional requirements.

    <p>The future requirements (section VII) should inform the design
      process if not initially implemented.
      
    <h3>II. Vision Statement</h3>

    <p>An electronic bulletin board system is one of the simplest and
      most effective forms of collaboration between people separated in
      space and time.  Bboards provide a centralized and shared venue
      for discussion that save communication costs over ad-hoc
      mechanisms (like arbitrary email lists).  Since messages are
      organized by topic as well as temporally, bboard can provide
      lightweight interfaces for rapidly navigating to interesting
      messages.  This low barrier to participation encourages
      spontaneous collaboration between disperse parties in the
      community.
      
    <p>The bboard system also serves as a useful archive and ad-hoc
      knowledge management tool by virtue of its persistence, light
      weight organizational structure, and flexible browse and search
      facilities.  This sort of knowledge base can be easily leveraged
      to provide long term pedagogical value as well as aid in future
      problem solving.
      
    <p>When integrated with an email system, bboards radically improve
      email based collaboration.  Email notifications can encourage
      continuous awareness of community issues.  Email based reply
      functionality further lowers the barrier to participation,
      encouraging more Interaction around the Transaction<sup>TM</sup>.
      
    <h3>III. System/Application Overview</h3>

    <p>The bboard system allows users to browse, read, and
      post messages organized into forums.  Messages consist of short
      text messages with optional attachments such as image files or
      html documents.  Messages are organized into threads when users
      reply to each other, maintaining the temporal flow of a particular
      discussion.
      
    <p>Forums are contexts for discussion relating to a particular
      domain of interest.  Examples include the photo.net Q&A forum, the
      ArsDigita Web/DB forum, and the away.com discussion forum.
      Messages within a particular forum can optionally be tagged as
      being in certain categories to assist searching and navigation.
      Forums are always created in the context of a subsite.

    <h3>IV. Use-cases and User Scenarios</h3>
    
    <p><b>Administrator</b>: Phillis Goodsport is a world famous
      lithographer who wants to share her knowledge about lithography
      and encourage interaction between a community of lithographers on
      her new site litho.net.  Although she likes the idea of a broad
      forum for general lithography discussion, she wants browsing to be
      tractable when traffic increases.  If quality goes down, she'd
      like to dedicate one of her minions to moderating traffic to
      maintain her high standards.
      
    <p><b>Casual browser and poster</b>: Joe Schmoe goes to photo.net
      for the first time and wants to ask what zoom lens to buy.  He
      needs to find the appropriate category/topic to post his message.
      
    <p><b>Compulsive reader and expert poster</b>: Jane Developer is a
      web development guru and wants to keep up with as much of the
      traffic on the web/db forum as possible.  She wants to become
      aware of posts that might become relevant to her in the future
      as well as help out folks who have problems she knows how to
      solve.  Since Jane is on lots of developer mailing lists, her
      preferred form of interaction is via email.

    <p><b>Moderator</b>: Dave Balderdash is a chatter.net moderator and
      wants to delete redundant or useless posts.  He's short
      on time, so he wants a quick interface for rejecting and approving
      posts.
      
   <p><b>Targeted researcher</b>: Ted Stetson is an ACS developer who
      remembers someone mentioning something about his Oracle problem on
      a bboard.  He wants to find records of similar problems and any
      related solutions.

    <h3>VI.A Requirements: User Interface</h3>
    <h4>End User Basics</h4>

    <p><strong>10.10.10</strong> The bboard system must provide
      mechanism for users to effectively choose which messages to read
      within a forum.  Bboard must provide an overview interface to
      enable users to find messages of interest or relevant to them.
      This overview should provide the user with cursory information to
      facilitate quick scanning and meaningful evaluation of message
      contents.
      
      <p><strong>10.10.15</strong> The full text of bboard messages
            should be searchable by user queries.

    <p><strong>10.10.20</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented] </font>Bboard should consistently provide
      a mechanism to limit or sort displayed posts by categories, posters,
      and date range as well as to perform a text search.
      
    <p><strong>10.10.30</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented] </font>Most users primarily want
      to browse and read new posts or replies since their last visit.
      The bboard interface must allow users to ignore messages they've
      already read.

    <p><strong>10.10.40</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented] </font>Users should be able to search within
      and limit scope to messages they have already read as well as
      messages they have not read at all.

    <p><strong>10.10.50</strong> Users must be able to easily post new
      messages to a bboard, or reply to existing messages they have come
      across.  When replying, users must be presenting with enough
      context to assist their composition.

    <h4>Email Integration</h4>

    <p><strong>10.20.10</strong> Users can register for email
      notification of new messages in a particular forums.

    <p><strong>10.20.13</strong> Users can register for email
      notifications on a particular thread.

    <p><strong>10.20.16</strong> Users can register for email
      notifications on a particular category.

    <p><strong>10.20.20</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented] </font>Notifications can be sent as each
      message arrives or in an organized digest form over a configurable
      time period.

    <p><strong>10.20.30</strong> Individual messages will have appropriate RFC 822
      headers to enable threading in the mail client.

    <p><strong>10.20.40</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented]
      </font>Email from the alert system should be tagged in the
      header with the site and forum name to enable easy filtering in
      mail clients.  Well, as easy as the mail clients make it anyway.

    <p><strong>10.20.50</strong> <font color="red"> [unimplemented]
      </font>If the user requests it, email generated should use MIME
      encoding to deliver attachements and appropriately encode HTML.
      Otherwise plain text emails should be augmented with URLs and
      styling cues in place of rich content.

    <h4>Administrative Requirements</h4>

    <p><strong>10.30.10</strong> The bboard system must support a
      flexible presentation layer that allows custom layout of bboard
      content.

    <p><strong>10.30.15</strong> Publishers should have the option of
        displaying discussions in a flat linear fashion or in an indented
	threaded view.

    <p><strong>10.30.20</strong> Parties with administrative
      privileges on a particular subsite can create, delete, and edit
      forums scoped to that subsite.

    <p><strong>10.30.30</strong> Forums can be designated moderated in
      which case parties with sufficient privileges must approve
      messages before they are displayed generally.

    <h4>Access Control Requirements</h4>

    Objects must be structured to allow the flexible configuration and
    assignment of the following privileges:
      
    <p><strong>10.40.10</strong> Reading forums

    <p><strong>10.40.20</strong> Reading messages

    <p><strong>10.40.30</strong> Posting new messages

    <p><strong>10.40.50</strong> Approving and rejecting posted messages
      (for moderated groups)

    <p><strong>10.40.60</strong> Managing the forum (editing title and
      description, determining moderation and restriction policies,
      granting approval privileges to others, banning users)

    <p><strong>10.40.70</strong> Managing categories (editing, deleting,
      combining categories)

    <h3>VI.B Requirements: Datamodel</h3>
    
    <h4>Messages</h4> 

    <p><strong>10.80.10</strong> Messages are the basic units of the
      bboard module.  The bboard system will provide a repository to
      store text messages.

    <p><strong>10.80.20</strong> Messages will be tagged as having
      HTML, plain text, or preformatted text in their body.

    <p><strong>10.80.30</strong> Messages will have a brief plain text
      subject line.
      
    <p><strong>10.80.40</strong> Messages will be related to their
      creating user.

    <p><strong>10.80.50</strong> Messages may optionally have 
      binary attachments.

    <p><strong>10.80.60</strong> The bboard system must store relations
      between messages and their replies to enable threaded views.

    <h4>Forums</h4> 

    <p><strong>10.90.10</strong> Forums are the main administrative
      units of the bboard system.  Forums are containers to which
      messages uniquely belong.

    <p><strong>10.90.20</strong> Forums must have a brief text
      descriptions and optionally a longer description called a charter.

    <h4>Categories</h4>

    <p><strong>10.100.10</strong> There must be a mechanism for
      intra-forum categorization to facilitate filter, searching, and
      tractability.

    <h3>VI.C Requirements: API</h3>

    <font color="red">No requirements in this section are met by the
      current implementation.</font>

    <p>Since bboard is primarily an end user application any exposed
      APIs will come out of the design rather than nailed down
      requirements from the start.  Stay tuned.

    <h3>VI.D Possible Future Requirements</h3>

    <p><strong>10.255.10</strong> bboard should provide a framework
      for extending the generic messaging repository with meta-data
      and in tandem extending the user interface to take advantage of
      this meta-data.  This would let developers properly layer
      functionality such as geo-spatial messaging and slashdot style
      scoring. This is actually provided via ACS messaging and the ACS
      Object system.
      
    <p><strong>10.255.20</strong> bboard should support replying to
      and initiating threads from email.  Administrative email list
      functionality should be developed or integrated.

    <p><strong>10.255.30</strong> Bboard should let users register
      interests (categories, certain users, keywords) for the purpose of
      filtering and sorting message displays.

    <p><strong>10.255.40</strong> Users should have the option of
      enabling spell checking on their posts. A framework for filtering
      (removing bad words, promoting text URLs to html links, auto
      detecting HTML vs. plain text, etc.,) should exist.

    <p><strong>10.255.50</strong> Allow users to configure how big the
      textareas editing widgets they get are.

    <p><strong>10.255.60</strong> Moderators should be given the
      <em>option</em> of making notes on a given discussion that appear
      prominently in the discussion display.

    <p><strong>10.255.70</strong> Moderators should be able to set
      posts to expire at a configurable time in the future.

    <p><strong>10.255.80</strong> Mega bonus points: an nntp gateway to
      bboards for access from standard news clients.

    <p><strong>10.255.90</strong> The bboard system should be able to
      take advantage of a caching system that stores the results of
      database queries for optimal scalability.

    <p><strong>10.255.100</strong> Publishers should have the option
      of allowing users to edit various parts of messages after they are
      posted (e.g. the text body, the subject, the text presentaiton
      style etc.,)

    <p><strong>10.255.110</strong> A user interface should allow
    administrators to easily categorize or recategorize existing
    messages.

    <p><strong>10.255.120</strong> Publishers should be able to
    classify users based on their forum contributions and
    appropriately target them for email, promotions, etc.,
      
    <p><strong>10.255.130</strong> Explicit permissions for posting
    new messages vs. posting replies.

    <p><strong>10.255.140</strong> Explicit permissions for posting
    attachments.
