BBoard is a web based discussion system for the ArsDigita Community
System.  Once installed and mounted, bboard instances provide
locations on the site that contain discussion forums
(e.g. http://developer.arsdigita.com/bboard/).  Users can post and
read messages within individual forums, which are generally geared
towards specific topics or audiences.  This basic functionality is
supplemented with a variety of additional features including image and
file message attachments, email notification, categorization, and
moderation facilities.
